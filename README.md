# Letter template to websites that still store your password in plaintext

The following is a template that can be used to contact your favorite service or product provider to request that they stop storing your password in plaintext. It's best to send it to both customer support as well as any management channels directly to increase your odds of response. Most of the management for companies can be found on Linkedin and won't necessarily respond to emails from the public.

Before sending this message to the company in question, you may want to first add them to [https://plaintextoffenders.com/submit](Plaintextoffenders.com) and link to that submission in this letter as well as a sign of seriousness. Management usually only make changes in their practices when they fear it will have adverse affects on public image if they don't. Threatening to do things doesn't usually work as much as actually doing them, but use your own judgement as not all companies and projects are run the same.

> Hi team at COMPANY_NAME,
> 
> My name is MY_NAME and I've been a user of your services for a while. I love to support products and services that do a good job, and I've always loved supporting yours as well. Unfortunately I recently learned that your website is storing my password in plaintext. That means that when you have a username and password for logging into and using your service, you're just writing that password directly into a database without hashing it first.
> 
> This means that any hacker, disgruntled employee, or exploit that allows for a leak of the data in that database will make my password public. This was considered insecure even in 2010, and since then there have been billions of website databases from every company, both large and small hacked or leaked causing every sort of damage from identity theft to the hacking of other accounts owned by those users. A regularly updated database of these leaks can be seen at https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites. No company is too big or too small to be hacked, or have their databases leaked. All it takes is one bored hacker and one mistake on the part of the database admin or website developer.
> 
> I write to you to ask you to change this policy of storing plaintext passwords per the industry norms of all modern websites and services, and if you happen to have no idea what this email is talking about I encourage you to do a web search for "plaintext password database leak" and see the companies and services who have ruined their business reputation to their customers by not doing such a basic thing as having their users' passwords stored hashed. Or you can see this StackExchange question where someone like me was asking for how to contact a company they too wanted to support to ask them the same thing (https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/7118/what-to-do-about-websites-that-store-plain-text-passwords). 
> 
> If you're not sure how to do it or think it would require a lot of development work, know that many database softwares already have the functionality to do this for you automatically through changing a property for the database field itself, and that regardless of what software is used to login to or reset passwords on your site, minimal modification would be needed to do this properly.
> 
> If you love your business, want to keep your reputation, and want to keep me as a happy customer, I ask that you do what every security professional in the world has directed every database-using company to do since decades ago.
> 
> Please don't store my password in plaintext. I look forward to your response. I will in the meantime be adding your service to plaintextoffenders.com to warn the world not to use your service until this has been remedied as every day it goes on is another day a user's account is at risk.
